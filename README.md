# _BigQuery from CSV_

#### By _Bri Chavez_

#### _This application is a series of functions that will clean data from a csv and will use bigQuery to assess the data_

## Technologies Used

* _VSCode_
* _Python_
* _Pandas_
* _SQL_
* _Terminal_
* _Google Cloud Console_
* _BigQuery_

## Description

_More accurately, this takes a csv compiled of thousands of ufo sightings information. So, we are going to take that information, turn it into a paNDAS dataframe, scrub it down until its easier to read, and ask it a bunch of questions about similarities and differences._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Copy the code from https://github.com/BriChavez/bigquery_test.git_
* _Clone the repo to where you want to use it from_
* _Run the bash line to download the csv to a subsequent data folder_
* _From the terminal, activate a virtual environment and run pip install -r requirements.txt_
* _Once you have this ran, you can run python3.7 main.py to clean the cvs_
* _Read the shiny new csv into your favorite sql or sql like platform._
* _Use either the questions, or get creative and ask your own_

## Known Bugs

* _Duration is a string and is not uniform_
* _City column contain country information_
* _State column could be left merged with the city column_

## License

_I would love if you want to take this code out for a spin. Please let me know if you find anything fun, have ideas about how I could more efficiently write my code, or if you have any other suggestion, maybe a dataframe you would like to see merge?
